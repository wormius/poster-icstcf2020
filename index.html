                    <p>A representative method with this approach is called "molecular dynamics simulation". 
                        In this method, the motion of the particles is calculated from Newton’s equation of 
                        motion in the classical theory.</p>

                    <h1>Force matrix</h1>
                    <p>

                        Let’s call <em>matrix force</em> to a matrix with <b>N</b> rows and <b>N</b> columns, 
                        where each element in the row <b><em>i</em></b> and column <b><em>j</em></b> contains the value of the force 
                        <b><em>f<sub>ij</sub></em></b> due to the interaction between particle <b><em>i</em></b> 
                        and particle <b><em>j</em></b> of a system with <b>N</b> particles.
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The calculation of the forces, consequence of particle’s interactions, 
                    is a crucial and time-expensive step in any molecular simulation. <span>As the number 
                        of particles increases, the number of interactions does quadratically.</span>

                <h1>About CUDA</h1>
                <p> The CUDA technology for NVIDIA graphics cards provides
                    a development interface to make programs that take advantage of
                    the GPU’s processor calculation capacity. The CUDA architecture allows 
                    to implement functions (called kernels) to be executed by several 
                    threads simultaneously.

                    <p>The CUDA programming model assumes a system composed of a host (cpu) and a device (gpu), 
                        each with their own separate memory. <br>
                        <br> CUDA threads may access data from multiple memory spaces during their execution, for example:</p>

                                In CUDA, the kernel is executed with the aid of threads. The thread is an abstract entity that 
                                represents the execution of the kernel. A kernel is a small program or a function. Every thread 
                                has an index, which is used for calculating memory address locations and also for taking control 
                                decisions.

                <h1>Our work</h1>
                <p>
                    We created a set of algorithms to calculate,
on the GPU, the matrix force for systems with different numbers
of particles. These algorithms were compared with each other.
and against other that does the same procedure but executed on
the CPU. <br>
Only two computational optimizations were implemented for
the CPU algorithm: cutoff radius (the distance which the particles
are far enough apart to neglect the force between them) and the
use of Newton’s third law (which reduces to a half the number of
forces calculated) <br>
All the algorithms that we created to run on GPU apply the
same strategy respect the use of available memory spaces in this
technology: inside the kernel, each thread copies the necessary
data from global memory to the shared memory. Once the threads
of a block have finished their work, the results are sent back to the
global memory. If it is possible, input parameters of functions are
sent at the constant memory space. <br>
The main difference between the algorithms for GPU in this
study, consists in the format of the grid used in each kernel for
calculate the matrix force.

                    <p>
                        Algorithm A uses a 1D grid with 1D blocks, using a single thread to 
                        reduce a complete row in the matrix of forces, applying only the 
                        cutting radius optimization.

                        Algorithm A* uses a technique that 
consists by using the same grid as many times are necessary (block-stride technique), 
allowing to send a smaller grid to avoid the problem of thread limits.

                        Algorithm B uses a 2D grid with 2D blocks, using one row
of threads of each block to work on reducing two complete rows
of the matrix force, applying the cutting radius optimization and the Newton’s third law optimizations.

                        Algorithm C reuses the idea of algorithm A*, but for a 1D
grid with 2D blocks, using one row of threads of each block to

through the matrix force in a staggered way, with the aim of taking advantage of Newton’s third

                        The comparison showed that algorithms that use the block
stride technique are more efficient than those that do not. Our
implementation of Newton’s third law as optimization to calculate the matrix force on GPU, 
achieves an evident advantage in systems with a large number of particles
